To build on networking and GitHub skills

This chat program will be built to eventually encompass everything needed for a good chat.
Privacy, efficiency and speed will the pillars of which the program is built.

Eventually, don't know how, but this program will allow for two clients to communicate with each other over the internet without
having to open ports on their home network OR use a dedicated server to send their messages.
